# Election_Analysis

##Use PyPoll_Challenge.py file for assignment, election_results.csv in Resources, and election_analysis.txt in Analysis.

##Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to use provided election data for 3 counties and perform an analysis on the results using Python. We were tasked with calculating the total votes by county, percentage of total votes, and the vote breakdowns for each candidate.

##Election Audit Results

 - How many votes were cast in this congressional election? = 397,711 Votes
 - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the   precinct.

Jefferson	 38,855 
Denver	 306,055 
Arapahoe	 24,801 

 - Which county had the largest number of votes?
 Denver
 
 - Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
 
Charles Casper Stockham	 85,213 
Diana DeGette	 272,892 
Raymon Anthony Doane	 11,606 

 - Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total vote
 
 Diana DeGette	 272,892 (73.8%)
 
 This script could be used to sum the total votes for each county and each candidate. This could potentially be reused/recycled in another election though election results data would have to be provided in a .csv for the script to run.
